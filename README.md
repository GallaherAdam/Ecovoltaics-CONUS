Python code developed for processing and analyzing USDA CDL data. <br/>
CDL_Preprocess.py is a preprocess function which cleans up raster data based on study area (e.g., CONUS). <br/>
Main_Script.py pulls the processed data in and applies the set minimum mapping unit and binary classification for this analysis (i.e., corn vs non-corn pixels).
